# Assignment-1 Mamamoo Website
In this project I am trying to create a website for a well known k-pop girlgroup Mamamoo, who like most K-pop groups do not have their own website. While they do have a [page under their company's website](http://www.rbbridge.com/?page_id=23470) that displays their individual discography, some insight to the programs and activities that the members have taken part in, albums that they hacve put out as well as a short description of the group as a whole, I feel like it wouldn't help to allow people who have just become intrested in the group to be able to learn more about them and the members. In addition, as the most their discography is shown is just the album names and the date they were released, I think that it'd be better to allow people to also view what each album and the group as a whole has to offer.

## Design process
My main goal of this website is to allow fans to have a space where important infomation about the group can be easily accessed like their discography or infomation and facts about the members.
- From a perspective of someone who had just discovered the group, with a website like this, which compiles most of the infomation of the group, as well as their discography, it can allow them to get to know the members and their abilities better while also being able to familarise themselves with their music. 
- From the perspective of a fan, with a subscription section, they would be able to recieve updates about new releases.
- Most of the sites that are about Mamamoo, including the official page is in Korean as they are a Korean girl group, but as their fame increases and they attract more international fans, I thought that having a site in English would allow them to be gain more reliable information from them.

## Features 
Existing Feeatures:

1) There is a would be a main landing page which displays a group photo of the members as well as buttons that link to all the other pages
2) The about page which would feature information of the group as a whole as well as infomation about each of the members accompanied by an indivudual picture
3) The Discography page, showing off the different albums and EPS that they have released over the years
4) The indivdual album pages that would showcase the title track of the album as well as the various b-sides in the album.
5) The subscription/ contact page that would include a form that asks for the user's email and name and users can then choose on what they would want to be updated on.

Features to be implemented:

1) One feature that I wasn't able to add was a page displaying their past and upcoming concerts as it would make sense for fans to be able to see when and where their next live performances may take place. In addition they could also get notifications on upcoming tours which may be a good feature for fans who would like to see them perform live.
