# Assignment-1 Mamamoo Website
In this project I am trying to create a website for a well known k-pop girlgroup Mamamoo, who like most K-pop groups do not have their own website. 

#Design process
My main goal of this website is to allow fans to have a space where important infomation about the group can be easily accessed like their discography or infomation and facts about the members.
- From a perspective of someone who had just discovered the group, with a website like this, which compiles most of the infomation of the group, as well as their discography, it can allow them to get to know the members and their abilities better while also being able to familarise themselves with their music. 
- From the perspective of a fan, with a subscription section, they would be able to recieve updates about new releases.

#Features 
Existing Feeatures:
1) There is a would be a main landing page which displays a group photo of the members as well as buttons that link to all the other pages

 Features to be implemented:
 1) The about page which would feature information of the group as a whole as well as infomation about each of the members accompanied by an indivudual picture
 2) The Discography page, showing off the different albums and EPS that they have released over the years
 3) The indivdual album pages that would showcase the title track of the album as well as the various b-sides 
 4) The subscription/ contact page that would include a form that asks for the user's email and other infomation for them to recive updates on new releases/ events
